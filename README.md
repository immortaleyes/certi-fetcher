npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Database

Set up a **MongoDB** or **MySQL** database. You'll need to update the connection string in the `.env` file or the appropriate configuration file for your database.

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

### How to Fetch and Verify a Certificate:

1. **Enter Certificate Details**: On the homepage, input certificate information such as certificate ID, user ID, and platform (e.g., **HackerRank**, **Coursera**).
2. **Click 'Fetch'**: Press the **Fetch** button to retrieve the certificate.
3. **Verify Certificate**: Once the certificate is fetched, the tool will verify its authenticity and display the verification result.
4. **Batch Verification**: You can upload a CSV file with multiple certificate IDs and user details for batch verification. This helps in verifying large numbers of certificates at once.

### Example:

1. Certificate ID: **12345678**
2. Platform: **Coursera**
3. User ID: **987654321**
